# Vulnerable Services & Exploitable Network Protocols

This repository documents the **most risky, vulnerable, and commonly exploited network services**
from a **security, SOC, and penetration‑testing perspective**.

The structure is **risk‑first and exploit‑driven**, inspired by:
- Exploit‑DB
- Metasploit Framework
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Real-world incident response

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify **high‑risk services** by design or misconfiguration
- Map services to **real exploits, CVEs, and attack techniques**
- Help SOC analysts, students, and pentesters **prioritize threats**
- Provide a **service‑agnostic vulnerability reference**
